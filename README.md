#Notes!

1. I've removed the configureation urls, you can fill them in at config.js
 - searchUrl : is api1
 - metaDataUrl : is api2 but ending with just metadata/

2. There is logging its set to debug in config.js if you want it to be quiet turn set it to error or info

3. I made the errors always respond back with a message, normally for APIs I would just respond with an empty object but without knowing all the business requirements I went with messaging.

4. Application starts at app.js

5. If you have any questions just ask!

6. Thanks for the quiz it was a fun challange to question everything I thought I knew.
